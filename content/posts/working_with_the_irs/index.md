In the digital age, the traditional fax machine may seem like an outdated method of communication. However, when it comes to dealing with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), faxing can be an efficient and secure way to send and receive documents. This article explores how to leverage Faxtail, an online faxing solution, to resolve issues with the IRS.

## How to Use Faxtail for IRS Communications
### Step 1: Gather Your Documents

Before you can send a fax, you need to have all your documents ready. This may include tax forms, letters of dispute, or any other relevant paperwork. Ensure that all documents are clear and legible.
### Step 2: Digitize Your Documents

Scan your documents to create digital copies. Make sure to check the quality of the scans to ensure that all text and images are clear.

### Step 3: Send Your Fax

Once your documents are ready, go to Faxtail's website. Enter the IRS's fax number, upload your documents, and pay with PayPal. Faxtail will then send your fax in under a minute, with three automatic retries to ensure successful transmission.

## Using Faxtail to Resolve IRS Issues
